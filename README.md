### 🎓 Personal Brand

As I mentioned in my "About" section, I enjoy working on personal side projects. 
One such project is [BoostMMR](https://boostmmr.ru/), which I began in mid-2018. It is a full-fledged and profitable project 
with approximately 50,000 lines of code, which I have delegated to a friend for management. 
There is a [GitHub “slice”](https://github.com/Renhor/bmr-slice) of the project.
